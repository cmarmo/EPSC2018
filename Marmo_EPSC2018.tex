\section*{Abstract} % Abstract section

Atmospheric transient events are subject of observation and investigation of a growing community.
Professional as well as amateur observation networks are established in Europe and abroad
to collect data important not only for the scientific investigation of some physics processes
but also to assess their possible impacts on Earthâ€™s environment.
We propose here an implementation of the Virtual Observatory Event standard to the domain of
meteors and Transient Luminous Events (TLEs).
A well establish standard for real-time alert on those domains will facilitate coordination between
networks and make easier the extraction of critical information.
Improving collaboration between the amateur community and agencies (eg the ESA Fireball Database,
or the CNES Taranis mission).
